General Course description


•       Technology is rapidly changing, a first step to

        understanding these technologies is electric circuit theory

•       An electrical circuit is a system of interconnected components such as

         resistors, capacitors, inductors, voltage sources, and so on.

•       The electrical behavior of these components is described by

         a few basic experimental laws.

•       These laws and the concepts, mathematical relationships,

        and methods of analysis that have evolved from them are known as circuit theory.







Course objectives


provide the students appropriate fundamental knowledge in understanding and analyzing electric circuits and systems

Develop mathematical concepts necessary to accomplish the above.

teach real-world applications of circuits and systems including selected systems used in signal conditioning in physiological measurement circuit

Learning Outcomes


Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to:

•       Use basic Electrical Laws and theorems to solve DC and AC electrical circuit problems

•       Capable of analyzing electric circuit and system containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors for transient and steady-state response;

•       Apply mathematical and physical knowledge to analyze electrical circuits.

•       Develop capabilities in both hands assembling basic DC and AC circuits as well as using computer to simulate and explore the behavior of electric circuits.

Capacitors and First-Order RC Circuits


•       Capacitors, Permittivity, Capacitance, RC Circuits

•       In this chapter, we look at capacitance and its basic properties, capacitors in dc and in ac applications.

•       the equilibrium potential between two sides of this cell’s membrane neuron given the membrane resistance and capacitance.

•       defibrillator circuit



Inductors and First-Order RL Circuits


•       First-Order RL Circuits.

•       transients occur in inductive circuits because inductor current cannot change instantaneously, and calculate the voltages and currents that result.

•       Inductors, chokes, electromagnetic induction and inductance, transformers.



Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis


•       Average and RMS Values of

•       The Phasor, Admittance, Impedance

•       AC Analysis Methods, Resonance, and Matching

•       Power in AC Circuits

•       Inductive Coupling and Transformers



Second-Order RLC Circuits


•       Second-Order RLC Circuits

•       Filters: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-reject filter circuits

•       Second  order  circuit are  used Sometimes single stage may not enough to remove  all unwanted  frequencies
